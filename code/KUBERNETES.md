## Kubernetes
My notes on how to setup Microservices on GCP Kubernetes with NGINX, Cert Manager and continuous delivery on Gitlab.

Kubernetes is an open source container scheduling and orchestration system. It was originally created by Google and then donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes automatically schedules containers to run evenly among a cluster of servers, abstracting this complex task from developers and operators.

### Guide
1. [Google Cloud Platform](kubernetes/GCP.md)
2. [kubectl](kubernetes/KUBECTL.md)
3. [Continuous delivery with GitLab CI and Kubernetes](kubernetes/GITLAB.md)
4. [Cert Manager](kubernetes/CERT-MANAGER.md)
5. [NGINX](kubernetes/NGINX.md)
